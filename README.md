# Dynamic UI elements

This repo has apps for dynamic/conditional UI elements.

## Overview 

This repo is a collection of dynamic/conditional UI elements. Dynamic/conditional UI elements in a shiny app allows the interface to respond and update based on user inputs (`inputId`s). This means that the appearance and behavior of the UI elements will change according to the user interaction.
